&par Example Description

This example describes how to use TMR2 Channel2(PA1) measure frequency of external signal.
User can view the "frequency" value through serial terminal.

TMR2_IRQHandler Function to calculate:
Frequency = (RCM_ReadPCLKFreq()*2) / (Capture) Hz.
The minimum frequency value to measure is 1 Hz.

  - using TMR2 CHANNEL2(PA1) connect the external signal
